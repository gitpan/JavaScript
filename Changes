0.53 Fri Mar 18 19:49:25 CET 2005 (Joost Diepenmaat)
        - Added JS_THREADSAFE define, which fixed bug on perl 5.8.5
          thread-multi linux
        - added tests for debian spidermonkey libs (debian users can
          now do "apt-get install libsmjs-dev" and compile the module)
        - Added JS_PROP_ACCESSOR
        - Added conversion of boolean values from JS to Perl
        - moved JS_THREADSAFE to Makefile.PL and made code handle handle
          both cases (though it appears to be mandatory to get the code
          to run on perl 5.8.6 threaded and unthreaded)
        - Fixed a couple of alloc()s
