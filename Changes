Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript.

1.07 Tue May 6 2008
    - Makefile.PL should abort with exit code 0 if conditions are not met instead of exit code 1.
    - Don't increase refcount for object originating from Perl (James Duncan).
    - Make bind_value croak if trying to rebind an already existing property.
    - bind_value (object|function) will now throw an error if the target already exists. [rt.cpan.org #35572]
    - Added unbind_value to remove objects, functions and value from the context. [rt.cpan.org #35572]
    - Fix longtime memory leak caused by decreasing refcount on RV instead of on the 
      SV the RV references. [rt.cpan.org #35571]
    
1.06 Fri Apr 18 2008
    - Objects returned when creating constructor for bound classes should not increment
      refcount because this causes the objects to never be freed (James Duncan)
    - Docs stated argument constructor could be omitted in bind_class which wasn't the case and 
      so now it can and a default constructor will be created.
      
1.05 Tue Apr 1 2008
    - Drop support for error handlers
    - This module now requires SpiderMonkey 1.7 or later.
    - Makefile.PL now compiles a small test to see if libs and headers can be found
    - Makefile.PL now discovers install locations on CentOS5 (Gavin Carr)
    - Drop support for Perl 5.6.x and earlier because we need some API symbols not available there 
      and they don't support unicode properly either. [rt.cpan.org #31114]
      
1.04 Sat Nov 17 2007
    - Skip exception tests on engines less than 1.7 since these seem to be broken.
    - Free memory allocated by JS_smprintf when converting from utf8 strings (spotted by Ash Berlin)
    - Don't call js_ValueToXMLString but instead call JS method "toXMLString" on the object [rt.cpan.org #26411]
    - Convert 64bit Perl ints to JSDouble if they are too big to fit in JS ints [rt.cpan.org #26474] (Niko Tyni)
    - Add more include paths when building on debian [rt.cpan.org #26411] (Niko Tyni)
    - Fix typo in exceptions.c that didn't get global object correctly [rt.cpan.org #26411] (Niko Tyni)
    - Use JS_ExecuteScript instead of js_Execute [rt.cpan.org #26411] (Niko Tyni)
    - Allow keys/properties to be unicode (Fotango)
    - Object construction can now throw exceptions and it'll propagate to JS space [rt.cpan.org #26215]
    - Handle recursive structures better (Fotango)
    - Specify $(O_FILES) instead as a list of .o files as Writefile(OBJECT => ...)
    - Use JS_CallFunction instead of js_InternalCall so we can link aginst libjs build with hidden internals [rt.cpan.org #26411]
    - Remove support for custom stacksize since it's not what we thought it was (Fotango)
    - Add tests for exceptions (Fotango)
    - Split up giant .XS file into smaller pieces
    - Added CREDITS to MANIFEST so it's bundled with the distribution
    
1.03 Wed Feb 21 2007
    - Honor value of JS_ENABLE_E4X
    - Improved README
    - Added CREDITS
    - Remove unused variables to silence some cc warnings
    - Remove ; from #include directive that can cause compilation warning (Fotango)
    - Skip t/24-c-level-interrupt-handler.t if Inline::C is not installed (Fotango)
    - Added module Test::JavaScript::More that's like Test::More but for JavaScript (Fotango)
    - Added support extending JavaScript::Runtime. This obsoletes "(void *) ext" field in PJS_Runtime and PJS_Context.
    - Added support for multple interrupt handlers. One at perl level and unlimited at C level.
    - A report->linebuf that's NULL should be undefined and not an empty string (Fotango)
    - Use SvPVutf8 macro instead of accessing via sv_2svutf8 (Fotango)
    - Added JavaScript->supports(@features) to check feature support such as e4x, ut8, threading.
    - Added does_support_utf8, does_support_threading and does_support_e4x. But really one should
      be using the method above.
    - Bridge E4X objects into perl space as strings (Fotango)
    - Allow building with debug symbols (set JS_DEBUG to a true value) (Fotango)
    - Allow setting JS_THREADSAFE and JS_UTF8 to true/false to avoid the prompts (Fotango)

1.02 Mon Feb 12 2007
    - Makefile.PL now generates a JavaScript_Env.h that sets correct defines and includes correct headers
    - Structs, macros etc are now in a JavaScript.h
