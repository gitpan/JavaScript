Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript.

1.03 ...
    - Honor value of JS_ENABLE_E4X
    - Improved README
    - Added CREDITS
    - Remove unused variables to silence some cc warnings
    - Remove ; from #include directive that can cause compilation warning (Fotango)
    - Skip t/24-c-level-interrupt-handler.t if Inline::C is not installed (Fotango)
    - Added module Test::JavaScript::More that's like Test::More but for JavaScript (Fotango)
    - Added support extending JavaScript::Runtime. This obsoletes "(void *) ext" field in PJS_Runtime and PJS_Context.
    - Added support for multple interrupt handlers. One at perl level and unlimited at C level.
    - A report->linebuf that's NULL should be undefined and not an empty string (Fotango)
    - Use SvPVutf8 macro instead of accessing via sv_2svutf8 (Fotango)
    - Added JavaScript->supports(@features) to check feature support such as e4x, ut8, threading.
    - Added does_support_utf8, does_support_threading and does_support_e4x. But really one should
      be using the method above.
    - Bridge E4X objects into perl space as strings (Fotango)
    - Allow building with debug symbols (set JS_DEBUG to a true value) (Fotango)
    - Allow setting JS_THREADSAFE and JS_UTF8 to true/false to avoid the prompts (Fotango)
